I'm Luke, he/him. I'm professionally employed, but everything here is my hobby projects - little side-things that, for whatever reason, I'm developing or maintaining, mostly for my own use. I love to program, I love to LARP, and I love sewing and purse design. A little bit of everything, you know; can't rest on your laurels. 

My big two projects are: 
- read-cl: A command-line single-word-speedreading program (RSVP reading). I developed this to use on UserLAnd (or Termux, but getting Textract installed on Termux feels like pulling teeth.) There's a lot of reason to doubt RSVP as a great comprehension tool - reading back to check things is good for comprehension, even though it slows you down - but the focused nature of the reading tends to prevent me from getting distracted with my own thoughts, so I like it.
- slapchop: An open-source Discord bot for rock-paper-scissors (and hidden-information challenges more generally). It's specifically developed for PvP challenges in the Mind's Eye Theater roleplaying game system - which is designed for live play, but has a thriving online play community. 

I've got a couple other things on the backburner: 
- dungeon3d: Doom-style raytracing in AsciiPanel+Java, with a few sample modules showing how it could be used to build a classic party-based dungeon crawler in the legacy of Wizardry. The game project itself is not actively being worked on, but the visual element is pretty cool, and I thought it might be of interest to other aspiring game developers. And - who knows? Maybe someday I'll get to work on it again.
- argonaut: Flexible wrapper around jsyn for building grooveboxes. Initial release candidate should be out soon.

I can be reached at code@haunteddolllovers.net if you've got any questions. :)
